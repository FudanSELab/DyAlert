# DyAlert
This is the implementation of DyAlert.

We can not make our experiment data publicly available since it is confidential data from a commercial enterprise. 

Thus, to show the format of the json data for dynamic graph construction, we write 'data_generator.py' function for generating example json data randomly, whose results do not correspond to the experimental results in our paper.
